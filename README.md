  It is an R package for implementing Penalized Multi-band Learning for Circadian Rhythm Analysis Using Actigraphy

---
  
  Our Penalized Multi-band Learning (PML) algorithm provides a novel method for studying circadian rhythm analysis. Specifically, it first applies Fast Fourier Transform to actigraph data and then uses shrinkage in machine learning to select dominant periodicities, the information from which is further used to characterize daily activity patterns.
